## IT-361 (Data Structures Laboratory)

### Experiment-1

Read data from FILE into an array. Write an implementation of bubble sort that can be used to sort the array. Use library function qsort to sort the array on i) rollNumber ii) name and iii) total of marks and save them in separate output files. Compare performance between your bubble sort implementation and qsort.

### Experiment-2

Implement an AVL tree using pointers. Read data from File into your AVL tree, generating a "verbose" of steps during inserting each student data in the tree. Generate output files for pre-, in- and post-order traversal of your tree.

### Experiment-3

Repeat Experiment-2 but with a Heap implemented using an array.

### Experiment-4

Demonstrate the efficacy of a stack in solving a) postfix expression evaluation and b) Stock Span problems. Prepare you own input files to prove the correctness of your programs. There should be output files tracing the different parts of your implementation at different debug levels.

### Experiment-5

Demonstrate the efficacy of Prim's and Kruskal's minimal spanning tree algorithms. Prepare you own input files to prove the correctness of your programs. There should be output files tracing the different parts of your implementation at different debug levels.

### Experiment-6

Demonstrate the efficacy of Dijkstra's minimum path algorithm. Prepare you own input files to prove the correctness of your programs. There should be output files tracing the different parts of your implementation at different debug levels.
